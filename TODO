Hook up recent documents support (though rumors are that it's slow)

Improve Find system
	Display location of results in thumbnails?
	Only display thumbnails of pages found?

Move to three page views:

 * Single page (prolly default for some backends)
 * Continuous scrolling
 * Side-by-side continuous scrolling

Sidebar improvements for ps/pixbuf, or PDF files without a TOC.

Improve look of combobox Thumbnails/Index

Print Page Selection (libgnomeprintui?)

Document Properties Dialog for document meta-data

Provide Desktop icon Thumbnailer for Documents

Make an object that handles the page count.

Move to having three sizing types:

 * Free zooming
 * constrain to width
 * constrain to height
 * also, maybe add a 1-1 button.  Possibly dubious, though.

At execution time, you must enable the log service. To enable the
log service, set the environment variable: EV_LOG_MODULES

EV_LOG_MODULES variable has the form:

	<moduleName>[:<moduleName>]*

moduleName is a filename.
ex: export EV_LOG_MODULES=ev-window.c:ev-view.c
The special log module "all" enables all log modules.

Use the LOG macro to put debug messages in the code.

WARNINGS

warnings, set the environment variable: EV_DEBUG_BREAK

Possibe value for EV_DEBUG_BREAK variable:

	stack		Prints a stack trace.

profiling service, set the environment variable: EV_PROFILING_MODULES

EV_PROFILE_MODULES variable has the form:

	<moduleName>[:<moduleName>]*

moduleName is a filename.
ex: export EV_PROFILE_MODULES=ephy-window.c:ephy-autocompletion.c
The special profiling module "all" enables all profiling modules.

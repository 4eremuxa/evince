SOME RANDOM COMMENTS:
=====================

 * We assume that all documents can be broken down into a linear
   collection of pages.

 * If a document type doesn't break down in such a way (like web pages)
   then it's probably not a good fit for this application.

 * Each page has a natural page size in pixels.  This is generally
   ignored in favor of a scale-to-fit mode, but is occasionally
   important for backends like the image backend.

 * Each page is not necessarily the same size.

 * We refer to pages by page number.  This number ranges from 1 to
   document->n_pages.  A page index of -1 means the current set page,
   and a page index of 0 is not used.

Thoughts on threading:

 * The primary thing we are trying to do is minimize switching pages, as
   doing so is slow for backends.  Additionally, some operations on the
   backend are slow, leaving poor interactivity.  This

<title>Why Didn't The Text I Selected Copy Properly?</title>


<p>
If you highlight and copy text from a document using <app>Evince</app> and then paste it into another 
application, the formatting may alter.  It may also contain different characters than the original selection. This often happens when copying text from a PDF document with multiple columns.
</p>


 <p>
  This problem happens because of how some document formats handle text. 
  The actual text in the document is stored differently from the way it is 
  displayed. This may result in a copy that does not appear as expected.
 </p>

 <p> 
  Unfortunately, there is no real way of fixing this problem. Copying 
  less text at a time, or copying the text into a text editor may minimise the problem. You can locate a text editor by clicking <guiseq><gui>Applications</gui><gui>Accessories</gui><gui>Text Editor</gui></guiseq>.
